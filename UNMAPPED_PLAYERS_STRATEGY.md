# üéØ Unmapped Players Research & Collection Strategy

## üìä **Current Situation**
- **37 players** still need previous club research and stat collection
- Successfully collected **12 players** already (proves our system works)
- Positions: 5 GK, 5 DEF, 25 MID, 2 FWD

## üîç **Phase 1: Research & Categorization (Priority Order)**

### **1. High-Impact Positions First**
**Forwards (2 players) - Highest draft value:**
- Eli Junior Kroupi (Bournemouth)
- Thierno Barry (Everton)

**Goalkeepers (5 players) - Unique position:**
- Djordje Petrovic (Bournemouth)
- Walter Benitez (Crystal Palace)  
- Giorgi Mamardashvili (Liverpool)
- Freddie Woodman (Liverpool)
- Marcus Bettinelli (Manchester City)

### **2. Promising Young Players**
**Look for these patterns in names (likely high-value prospects):**
- Estevao Willian (Chelsea) - Brazilian name, Chelsea = high priority
- Sverre Nypan (Manchester City) - Young Norwegian talent
- Dario Essugo (Chelsea) - Portuguese prospect
- Igor Jesus (Nott'ham Forest) - Brazilian striker

### **3. European League Players**
**Names suggesting European origin:**
- Olivier Boscagli (Brighton) - Dutch/French
- Maxim De Cuyper (Brighton) - Belgian  
- Borna Sosa (Crystal Palace) - Croatian
- Rayan Cherki (Manchester City) - French
- Jeremie Frimpong (Liverpool) - Dutch

## üî¨ **Research Methodology**

### **Step 1: Previous Club Identification**
For each player, research using:
1. **Transfermarkt.com** - Most reliable transfer database
2. **Wikipedia** - Player career history
3. **Club official websites** - Transfer announcements
4. **Football news sites** - Transfer reports

### **Step 2: League Classification** 
Categorize by previous league:
- **Tier 1** (Easy collection): Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1
- **Tier 2** (Moderate): Eredivisie, Portuguese Liga, Belgian Pro League
- **Tier 3** (Difficult): Brazilian Serie A, Championship, Other leagues

### **Step 3: Collection Strategy by Tier**
- **Tier 1**: Use our existing multi-league scraper
- **Tier 2**: Use targeted scraper with league-specific URLs
- **Tier 3**: Manual collection from league websites or skip if low priority

## üìã **Systematic Research Template**

For each player, create research entry:
```json
{
  "name": "Player Name",
  "current_team": "PL Club",
  "position": "Position",
  "previous_club": "Research Result",
  "previous_league": "League Name",
  "league_tier": "1/2/3",
  "collection_method": "scraper/manual/skip",
  "transfer_fee": "Fee if available",
  "age": "Age for priority",
  "notes": "Any special notes"
}
```

## üéØ **Priority Matrix**

### **Immediate Priority (Week 1):**
1. **All Forwards** (2 players) - Highest draft impact
2. **Young prospects at top clubs** (Chelsea, Man City players)
3. **Goalkeepers** (unique position value)

### **Medium Priority (Week 2):**
4. **European league players** (likely Tier 1/2 leagues)
5. **Defenders with attacking potential**
6. **Experienced midfielders**

### **Lower Priority (Week 3+):**
7. **Unknown/difficult to research players**
8. **Players from obscure leagues**
9. **Very young players with minimal professional experience**
